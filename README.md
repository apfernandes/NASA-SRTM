# NASA-SRTM

Reading NASA SRTM files and representing them with Apple Scenekit

I have always been a fan of the Space Shuttle missions and fascinated by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)

https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/

I will try to gather and explain some of the code that I have produced to represent the data from those missions. 

It still blows my mind that one can have access to land elevation data for almost all of the Earth and represent that information in 3D on a mobile phone.

Following are some sample images.
